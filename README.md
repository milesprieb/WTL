# Wearable Technology Lab (WTL) - Grand Challenges Research Project

The long-term objective of the project was to develop pervasive systems capable of monitoring
language, activity, and the physical state of users; modeling the userâ€™s cognitive and emotional
state to identify needs for intervention; and intervening through language-based conversation
and/or calming physical responses. The project is summarized in the figure below.
